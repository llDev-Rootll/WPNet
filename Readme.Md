-- Train steps
	First try with depth model freezed
	Then try with few layers unfreezed 

-- Try Image stacking -- multiple frames

-- Depth + Semantic ??

-- Frame stacking wrapper - how to stack the frames ?

-- Also can stack depth + rgb to make 4 channel ?? Checkout 


## Monodepth caveat - DONOT train from scratch - we do not have the compute capacity and time for that !
